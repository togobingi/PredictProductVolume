# PredictProductVolume
R Code to predict the volume of products based on certain features and past data

This program tests multiple regression analysis

I used Regression to build machine learning models for this analyses using 3 Machine Learning algorithms. I chose the best model (Random Forest in this case) to predict the sales of four product types.
